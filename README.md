# **Wheat Plant Disease Classification**

This project aims to classify wheat plant images into one of six categories using a fine-tuned MobileNetV2 model. The categories include:

- **Mite**
- **Aphid**
- **Septoria**
- **Mildew**
- **Smut**
- **Healthy**

Users can upload an image of a wheat plant through a Streamlit web application, and the model will predict the disease class along with a confidence score for each category.

## **Features**

- Image classification using a fine-tuned MobileNetV2 model.
- Confidence scores displayed for all classes.
- Simple and interactive web interface using Streamlit.

## **Tools and Technologies**

- **Python**: Programming language for model development and deployment.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: Frameworks used for training and loading the MobileNetV2 model.
- **Streamlit**: Framework for building the interactive web application.
- **Google Colab**: Environment for model training and running the app.
- **Ngrok**: Tool to expose the Streamlit app to the web.

## **Setup Instructions**

### **Model Training**
The MobileNetV2 model was fine-tuned on a custom wheat plant disease dataset.

The model was saved in the following path:
/content/drive/MyDrive/Technical assessment/filtered_dir/model_mobilenetv2_finetuned.h5


### **Web Application Development**
The web application was built using Streamlit. The core script is named `app.py` and is located at:
/content/drive/MyDrive/Technical assessment/filtered_dir/app.py


### **Project Directory Structure**

Technical assessment/ ├── filtered_dir/ │ ├── model_mobilenetv2_finetuned.h5 │ └── app.py


### **Running the Application on Google Colab**

**Step 1: Install Required Libraries**

Run the following commands to install dependencies:

!pip install streamlit ngrok tensorflow

**Step 2: Run the Streamlit App**

Execute the following command to launch the app:

!streamlit run /content/drive/MyDrive/Technical\ assessment/filtered_dir/app.py &>/content/logs.txt &

**Step 3: Create a Public URL**

Use Ngrok to expose the local Streamlit server:

from pyngrok import ngrok
public_url = ngrok.connect(port=8501)
print("Streamlit app is live at:", public_url)

Copy the public URL and open it in your browser to access the app.

## **Project Workflow**

### **Model Preparation:**
- A MobileNetV2 model was fine-tuned for wheat plant disease classification.
- The model predicts **six classes**.

### **Streamlit Web Application:**
- Users can **upload an image** via the app interface.
- The app preprocesses the image and passes it to the model for prediction.
- Results are displayed, including the **predicted class** and **confidence scores**.

### **Deployment:**
- The app is hosted on a local **Streamlit server** and exposed via **Ngrok** for public access.

## **How to Use**
1. Open the app using the **public URL** generated by Ngrok.
2. **Upload an image** of a wheat plant in **JPG**, **JPEG**, or **PNG** format.
3. View the **predicted class** along with **confidence scores** for all categories.
